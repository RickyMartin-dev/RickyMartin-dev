Hello, my name is Ricky Martin. 

I am a graduate from the University of California San Diego. I am currently looking for employment in the field of 
Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Mechatronics, Robotics, and/or Software Engineering. 
I am well versed in a multitude of subjects in order to best achieve any goal.

I am currently employed as an intern at The BioInspired Robotics and Design Lab (BRDL) at UC San Diego which is ran 
by Dr. Mike Tolley. My current focus is on Electronic Skin Development where I am utilizing supervised Machine Learning 
and Deep Learning techniques to develop a fabric based skin that senses live touch stimulation. This system has been 
proven to classify different touches (poke, rub, stroke, slap, etc.) with 98% accuracy both in a testing environment 
and when applied to a robotic arm. Through this I am attempting to bridge the gap between human robot interaction making 
communication with robots more efficient and direct. I was recently employed as a Data Scientist at Redica Systems where 
I utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assist the team in understanding FDA related Data. Within 
this position I have also constructed accurate classifiers to distinguish between different document types, developed 
techniques to tokenize and quantify text based data, and created business specific visualizations and KPI metrics for 
client digestion.

I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural 
Computation. My immediate goals lie in joining a company that is working on state of the art technology where my 
knowledge and skills as a programmer can be fully utilized, built upon, and tested. My goals beyond that lie in 
bringing “Sci-Fi” tech into the real world, taking much inspiration from individuals such as Elon Musk, Tony Stark, 
The Hacksmith, Thomas Eddison, and Leonardo da Vince just to name a few.

When I am not hard at work I like long walks on the beach, continuing my very important expedition to find New York's 
best coffee, Crossing off bucket list tasks, or becoming the true ghost of Tsushima.
